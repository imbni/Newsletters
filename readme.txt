This project is developed to generate newsletter templates automatically by following these steps:
1- opening the blog URL (for example http://www.autotrainingcentre.com/blog/category/locations/montreal/)
2- selecting latest blog posts based on the HTML DOM 
3- adding the content to the template

I used this PHP library:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/files/

Before developing this project the content managers spent around 30 minutes to copy/paste the content into the template 
but by using this project templates will be generated less than one minute and the content managers can use the generated
source HTML tags in any newsletter tool like MailChimp
